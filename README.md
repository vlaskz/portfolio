My API Portfolio for Hiring and things.

## This is part of my efforts to show to community and recruiters I know what I'm doing.

I'm using:
 * Spring Boot
 * Spring Data
 * Spring JPA
 * Spring Actuator
 * Spring DevTools
 * Lombok
 * MapStruct
 * MySQL
 * Docker
 * Maven
 
 All API's are Restfull and level 1 in Richardson Maturity Model. I'll implement levels 2 and 3 in some time.

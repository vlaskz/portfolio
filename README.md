### This is a sample of my knowledge about Java API with Spring Boot.

I'm using:
 * API Client with Exchange _GET/POST/PUT/DELETE_ Http Verbs
 * Pagination
 * Custom Exception Handling
 * Spring Validation
 * Spring Boot
 * Spring Data
 * Spring JPA
 * Spring Actuator
 * Spring DevTools
 * Lombok
 * MapStruct
 * MySQL
 * Docker
 * Maven
 
 _All API's are Restful and level 1 in Richardson Maturity Model. I'll implement levels 2 and 3 in some time._

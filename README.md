### This is a sample of my knowledge about Java API with Spring Boot.

I'm using:
* API Client with Exchange _GET/POST/PUT/DELETE_ Http Verbs
* API Testing with Postman/Insomnia
* Pagination
* Unit Tests
* Integration Tests
* Custom Profiles for Testing
* Custom Exception Handling
* Spring Validation
* Spring Security
* Spring Boot
* Spring Data
* Spring JPA
* Spring Actuator
* Spring DevTools
* Annotation Processing for Builders, Constructors, etc. with Lombok
* Relation Generation with MapStruct
* MySQL Containerization with Docker
* Build with Maven
 
 _All API's are Restful and level 1 in Richardson Maturity Model. I'll implement levels 2 and 3 in some time._
